          We custom fuse a Â¼ inch thick, multi-layered, glass ingot. This glass
          piece gets cut, shaped, fire polished, and annealed to ensure a
          perfect fit and finish. The finished result is an inlay that is up to
          200 times harder than regular glass. The glass gets installed flush
          with the granite surface and then finished with a cement based grout.
          The finished product is as strong as sandblasted granite itself.{" "}

            We sell a method of permanent color, not a particular style. We work
            hard to produce any type of design and strive to maintain the
            essence of the original artwork.
